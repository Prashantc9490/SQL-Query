I want to create trigger to maintained history, 
but the requirement is only to insert audit history table when particular column getting updated instead of all columns.


Basically we cannot create column level trigger in SQL SERVER, but we can handle; how, see below

CREATE TRIGGER Update_EntryDate
ON Dbo.Customer
AFTER UPDATE
AS
IF ( UPDATE (EntryDate))
BEGIN
Insert Into dbo.TableB (Value1, Value2, Value3)
Select Value1, Value2, Value3
From Deleted
END;
