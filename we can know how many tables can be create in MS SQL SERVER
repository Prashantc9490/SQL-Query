Is there a way that we can know how many tables can be create in MS SQL SERVER?
Maximum number of Tables in a SQL Database 
Most of the time developer asked “How many tables we can create on a SQL Server database”, even though sometimes interviewer asked same question and it looks weird to developer. 
Anyways, we are come to the answer of this question.  Actually in SQL Server, Microsoft has not defined any limit on number of tables but there is a limit on the number of Objects in a database.  
According to Maximum Capacity Specifications for SQL Server Tables per database are limited by number of objects in a database.  Database objects include objects such as tables, views, stored procedures, user-defined functions, triggers, rules, defaults, and constraints. The sum of the number of all objects in a database cannot exceed 2,147,483,647.
So if there is NO other objects created in a database you can create 2,147,483,647 numbers of tables in SQL Server database.
